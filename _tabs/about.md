Hi everyone! I'm Dario "danterolle" from Italy. I'm passionate about GNU/Linux systems and Open Source software, and I dedicate myself to writing Open Source software. My favorite programming languages are Go, Python, and JavaScript/TypeScript, which I work with daily.

Currently, I serve as a Core Developer for ParrotOS, in collaboration with Hack The Box.

Through this blog, I aim to share technical articles in both Italian and English. Stay tuned!
